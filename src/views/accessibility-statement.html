  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about-service">About this service</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">The GitHub Requests service is run by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office">Cabinet Office Digital</a>. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text disappearing off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the text simple to understand.</p>

    html: '<a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</a>'
